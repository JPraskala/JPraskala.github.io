            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p> Jacob's PyLearn is a site to help people learn the Python programming language.
                The purpose of the site is to help people who are interested in Python learn
                the basics such as data types, functions, if/else statements, switch statements,
                loops, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content will be divided into pages such as data types, arithmetic functions, string functions,
                if statements, switch statements, loops, etc. Each page will have a set number of questions.
                Completing a question will allow you to move onto the next question. When you do complete a question,
                you get a reward for doing so. This will encourage the user to continue learning the language.

            <h3>Page Design</h3>
            <div class="pages">
                <h4>Login Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The login page will ask a user to create or login into an existing account.
                    This will help a user keep track of their progress as they learn the Python
                    language. This page will need validation to check to see if the user typed
                    in the information correctly. There will be a button on the page to login or 
                    create an account, and when the user successfully creates or logins into an existing
                    account, the page will save any progress they have made.
                </p>
                <h4>Home Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The home page will be where the main content of the site will be.
                    It will include information such as what the site is about, the navigation bars,
                    FAQs, and a contact us panel. The user will not have to type any data onto this page.
                    The page will contain buttons to go to the sub-pages such as the About Us Page. This page is for 
                    anyone who is interested in the site.
                </p>
                <h4>About Us Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The About Us page will contain information on what the site is about and what  
                    our mission is. This page is for people who are interested in learning more about
                    the site. 
                </p>
                <h4>Sitemap Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The sitemap will be a unique page outlining all the content, and how the site is organized.
                    If someone is interested in seeing how the site was put together, they should go to this page.
                    There will be buttons on the page that links to each page that is listed.
                </p>
                <h4>FAQ Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The FAQ page will contain questions that users will be likely to ask.
                    Each question will have a dropdown, and if the user clicks on the dropdown, 
                    an answer will be revealed. Additionally, there will be links to websites
                    if anyone needs an external source for an answer.
                </p>
                <h4>Contact Us</h4>
                <p>
                    If the FAQ page does not answer your question, then you can contact us instead.
                    There will be a form to fill out. In this form, provide your name, email address, 
                    and your question. We will try to get to you as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <h4>Practice Page</h4>
                <p>
                    The practice page will give the user an introduction as to what the practice program is.
                    There will be a sub-menu on the page linking to each specific practice page such as if/else 
                    statement. These sub-pages will have a checker from JavaScript to check if the user answered correctly.
                    When the user correctly answers a question, the next question will open.
                    It is recommended the user completes these pages.
                </p>
                <h4>Data Types</h4>
                <p>
                    The Data Types page will introduce users to the basic data types in Python. These include: 
                    integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and more. It will start simple, but 
                    as the user progrsses, it will get more challenging (this will be the case in all the practice
                    sub-pages).
                </p>
                <h4>Math Functions</h4>
                <p>
                    This page will go over how to use the math functions that are in Python.
                    These functions include but are not limted to: math.ceil(), math.floor(), 
                    math.factorial(), math.gcd(), and more. The user will learn to use these functions 
                    by computing mathetmatical equations. 
                </p>
                <h4>String Functions</h4>
                <p>
                    This page will introduce users to Python's String Functions. These functions include 
                    but are not limted to: str.split(), str.upper(), str.lower(), str.isalnum(), and more. 
                    By the time the user is done with this page, the user will be comfortable computing 
                    the most basic string functions in Python. 
                </p>
                <h4>If/Else Statements</h4>
                <p>
                    If/else statements are vital in programming, and this page will teach users how to 
                    properly execute an if/else statement. The page will also refresh the user on booleans 
                    in Python by introducing them to boolean operators like > and ==.  
                </p>
                <h4>Switch Statements</h4>
                <p>
                    This page will introduce users an alternative to if/else statements known as switch statements. 
                    It will explain what a switch statement is, how to define cases, and why we need to put a 
                    break statement at the end of each case. When the user is finished, they will understand how 
                    switch statements work.
                </p>
                <h4>Loops</h4>
                <p>
                    Loops are another vital component in programming. In this page, users will be introduced to while loops 
                    and for loops. Users will have multiple exercises on both types of loops. They will learn how to define a while 
                    loop and a for loop, how to prevent infinite loops, and when to use them. 
                </p>
                <h4>Test</h4>
                <p>
                    After the user completes the practice pages, they have the option of taking a test to see what they have 
                    learned. It is only recommended for users to go to this page after they have completed the practice pages. 
                    A checker will be used to determine if the user got the correct answer or not. A user will complete a question, and 
                    they will move onto another question afterwards. Each question is worth 10 points.
                </p>
                <h4>Results</h4>
                <p>
                    After a user completes the test, the user can view their results. The user will have the option to print out those results, or 
                    have it emailed to their email address. If the user does not get a passing grade, the test can be attempted again.

            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>
                The JavaScript for the site will connect all the sites together. I plan on implmenting unit tests for the test page, and 
                each page will have a specific jquery ready function for when the page loads. I might also create some Jupyter Notebooks for 
                the practice pages so the user can have an interactive notebook when learning the material. Additionally, there is a chance 
                I could implement some backend on this site using NodeJS. I do have experience with backend development, and I know I can do it
                if I put in the time. If I choose to include some backend into the site, it will mostly serve the purpose of the login page. Example URLs 
                are below.
