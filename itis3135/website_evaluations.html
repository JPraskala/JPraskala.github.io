            <h3 class="examples"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Good Example (YouTube)</a></h3>
            <p>
                YouTube is a popular site that is known for a wide variety of videos. It is one of the most iconic websites of all time, and it continues to be popular to this day. 
                When evaluating the website, I noticed YouTube follows the CRAP principles really well. It has good constrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> It is easy to read everything on the website. The background is white, but the text is generally black making it easy to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The website is consistent with its styling. The videos are all organized the same way by having a thumbnail and a title below it; the taskbar on the side is also consistent to prevent confusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> I think Youtube has an organized style when it comes to its structure. You know where the videos are, and you know where your subscriptions are.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong> There is enough space to differentiate between different elements. For example, on the side of the screen, there are your subscriptions, but below that there is an hr tag detailing more options such as settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="examples"><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/apply/graduate-admission">Bad Example (Yale School of Art Admissions)</a></h3>
            <p>
                Yale is prestigious school, however, this specific website they have is poorly structured. This website is for Graduate Admissions into their Art program. 
                While the information presented might be useful, it does not properly follow the CRAP principles. I will explain why it does not follow the crap principles.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> There are instances when it is difficult to read. For example, the main header has black text, and it is wrapped in a yellow background making it difficult for me to see at first.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> This website actually does have good repetition. Everything is in sepearate blocks, but the design is not as professional as it could be.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment is the main part of the page is good, but in the header and footer, it is not centered.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The elements are grouped together, but there's not enough space between these elements.</li>
            </ul>
