                    Welcome to Jacob's PyLearn. This site will consist of you learning the Python programming language.
                    Python is one of my favorite languages, and I am excited to teach you about the wonderful features this 
                    language has. Throughout this site will consist of many topic such as data types, if/else statements, 
                    loops, and more. At the end, there will be a test to see how much you have learned. Good luck and have fun 
                    learning Python.
                </p>

                <h2>About Python</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Python is an open-source language that is free to use. It includes many packages such as Numpy, 
                    Flask, Pandas, and more. In fact, Python is the number one language for Artificial Intelligence. 
                    The language can also be used for backend development, gaming, engineering, etc. It is a begineer friendly language 
                    making it easy for people to utilize even those with no prior coding experience. If you are intersted, 
                    click on this <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">link</a> to learn more.

                    This website will have multiple pages dedicated to the Python language. You will create an account, and your 
                    progress will be tracked via this account. There will be a page on data types for example and loops. Completing each page 
                    will get you closer to understanding Python. I recommend taking your time with the exercises and try to understand what each 
                    question is asking. If you do this, then you will learn something.
